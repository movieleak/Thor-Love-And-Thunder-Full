<p>While Phase Four of the Marvel Cinematic Universe began with a focus on introducing new characters like Shang-Chi (Simu Liu) in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Yelena Belova (Florence Pugh) in Black Widow, and the Eternals in their self-titled feature film debut, Marvel Studios always intended to continue a few movie series from earlier phases.</p>

<p>That aspect of the strategy started with Spider-Man: No Way Home and will continue with July&apos;s Thor: Love and Thunder as well as the soon-to-be-released Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness.</p>

<p>It is notable for being one of just two Marvel Studios movies to reach a fourth installment (the other being Avengers: Endgame), and it also promises to build on themes from Thor: Ragnarok, which served as a soft relaunch. When Asgard is destroyed and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) abdicates his throne, how do you carry on the narrative?</p>

<p>Let&apos;s examine all we know about Love and Thunder to determine where it fits into Phase Four and how Thor Odinson is continuing to develop.</p>

<p>A film, also called a movie, motion picture, or moving picture, is a piece of visual art that uses moving images to show ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere. Most of the time, these images are accompanied by sound, and sometimes by other stimuli. The word &quot;cinema,&quot; which is short for &quot;cinematography,&quot; is often used to mean both the art form that comes from making movies and the business that makes them. The moving images in a movie are made by taking pictures of real scenes with a motion-picture camera, taking pictures of drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, using CGI and computer animation, or using a combination of some or all of these methods and other visual effects. Before digital production, film was a physical strip of film with a series of still pictures of live action taken at a rate of 24 frames per second. When the images are seen at the same speed, the illusion of motion is caused by something called persistence of vision. This is because the mind can&apos;t process individual images at that speed, so the images blend together to create the illusion of motion within the image. If the movie is animated in any way, the images that are far apart in time are meant to be seen at the normal speed. In the past, movies were recorded onto celluloid film stock using a photochemical process and then shown on a big screen using a movie projector. Films made today are often digital from start to finish, including production, distribution, and showing. In the past, films that were recorded on photochemical film had an analog optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected). Films are works of art made by certain cultures. They show how those cultures are, and in turn, they change those cultures. Film is seen as an important art form, a popular form of entertainment, and a strong way to teach (or brainwash) citizens. Films can reach everyone because they are based on images. Some movies have become popular all over the world because the dialogue has been translated into other languages through dubbing or subtitles. Frames are the individual pictures that make up a movie. When traditional celluloid films are shown, a rotating shutter makes dark spots as each frame is moved into place to be shown. However, the viewer doesn&apos;t notice the dark spots because of a phenomenon called &quot;persistence of vision,&quot; in which the eye keeps a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The phi phenomenon is a psychological effect that has something to do with how we feel motion. The word &quot;film&quot; comes from the fact that in the past, moving pictures were recorded and shown on photographic film, also known as &quot;film stock.&quot; A single moving picture can also be called a picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, or flick. In the U.S., people usually say &quot;movie,&quot; while in Europe, they say &quot;film.&quot; People often use terms like &quot;the big screen,&quot; &quot;the silver screen,&quot; &quot;the movies,&quot; and &quot;cinema&quot; to describe the field as a whole. &quot;Cinema&quot; is often used as an umbrella term in scholarly texts and critical essays. In the early days, sometimes the word sheet was used instead of screen. &quot;Film&quot; is not a good word to use to describe a long standard commercial video production because it is ambiguous and needs context to be understood correctly.</p>
